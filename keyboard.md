# General

Every time you find yourself using the mouse, think about ways to do that same thing with just the keyboard.

Pay attention to menu items! If a keyboard shortcut is available, it will be displayed next to it.

#### Keyboard preferences

*Key repeat*: turn that sucker up!
*Delay until repeat*: all the way down
This will allow you to navigate, delete faster (if you are going to use backspace) etc.

*Full keyboard access*: all controls. So you can hit tab etc to move through application boxes.

## Text editing OSX-wide

### ctrl-a
beginning of line

### ctrl-e
end of line

### ctrl-k
delete line to end

### cmd-left-arrow
beginning of line

### cmd-right-arrow
end of line

### alt-left arrow
move back 1 word

### alt-right arrow
move forward 1 word

### cmd-up / cmd-down
go to beginning or end, of text file or edit box

*tip*: Combine these with shift, to make a selection, this allows you to:
* delete it
* immediately start typing over it
* copy paste

You can also use the up arrow if you have multiple lines for quicker multi-line selection.

### fn-backspace
delete forward

### fn-alt-backspace
delete one word forward

### fn-cmd-backspace
delete line in front

### cmd-shift-v
paste and match style
This will make sure you paste it without any weird formatting.
