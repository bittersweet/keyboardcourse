      <h1>General</h1>
      <p>
        Every time you find yourself using the mouse, think about ways to do it
        without. In general, anything that you can do with the keyboard should be
        faster, because your hands can just stay on the keyboard.
      </p>

      <p>Pay attention to menu items! If a keyboard shortcut is available, it will be displayed next to it.</p>

      <h4>Keyboard preferences</h4>

      <p>
        <em>Key repeat</em>: turn that sucker up!
        <em>Delay until repeat</em>: all the way down
        This will allow you to navigate, delete faster (if you are going to use backspace) etc.
      </p>

      <img src="images/keyboard_preferences_2.png" />
      <p><em>Full keyboard access</em>: all controls. So you can hit tab etc to move through application boxes.</p>

      <h2>Text editing OSX-wide</h2>
      <p>
        The ones with control might seem a bit weird if you're not used to using
        ctrl at all, but give them a shot. It has the benefit of not having to
        relocate your right hand to the arrow keys.
      </p>
      <p>All of these shortcuts, work in <em>all</em> OSX text editting locations. That means your Chrome address bar, text fields on a webpage, when you edit a filename in the Finder, and yes, also Slack.</p>

      <h2>Combine these commands</h2>
      <p>Next to moving, you can combine them with shift to make selections, or with backspace to immediately delete them.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong>use alt-backspace when editting urls, it will remove everything until it encounters a slash.</p>

      <h2>OSX</h2>

      <h3>cmd-tab or cmd-shift-tab</h3>
      <p>move forward or backwards between apps. Pro-tip: you can quit apps from this menu without having to open them!</p>

      <h3>cmd-` or cmd-shift-`</h3>
      <p>move forward or backwards between windows of application</p>

      <h3>cmd-shift-`</h3>
      <p>other direction</p>

      <h3>cmd-shift-?</h3>
      <p>open help menu item (works in every app)
        From here you can type commands to see if they are available, see where they are, and if they have a keyboard shortcut</p>

      <p>Go backwards or forwards in history.</p>

      <h3>cmd-shift-g</h3>
      <p>As long as you are in the finder, so also when you hit 'open' from an application, you can hit cmd-shift-g to open a textbox to quickly navigate to where you know you want to go. You can use tab here to complete the paths.</p>

      <p>you can use the finder to easily drag files you're already viewing to an upload field</p>

      <h2>Vimium</h2>
      <p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">Vimium</a> is an awesome productivity tool for chrome. The killer feature in my opinion is the way you can open links (in tabs) with just the keyboard.</p>

      <h3>f</h3>
      <img src="images/vimium_links.png" />
      <p>Hit f and you'll see all the links available. Type one combination, and it'll open in the current tab. Use shift to make it open in a new tab in the background.</p>

      <h3>shift-w</h3>
      <p>Open tab to new window</p>
